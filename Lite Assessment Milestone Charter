# Project Charter: Lite Assessment Milestone
## Purpose
Establish a fast, reliable, and informative initial evaluation of a new MAIgnus_CAIrlsen user by analyzing their past 1 year of games with light Stockfish evaluation and early LLM insights.

## Goals
Build an initial game database from the user's last 12 months of Chess.com games.

Complete a Lite Assessment in a reasonable time (~1-2 hours maximum).

Generate a holistic snapshot of the player's:
- Overall skill level
- Play style
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Time control performance

Set the foundation for future Daily Game Reviews and Longitudinal Analysis.

## Scope
Fetch and cache 1 year of Chess.com games.

Run Stockfish analysis at depth 8 to minimize evaluation time.

Analyze all moves (no move sampling yet).

Summarize:
- Blunder/Mistake/Inaccuracy rates
- Opening tendencies
- Time control success rates
- General play style (via LLM)

Store results in a local SQLite database.

Generate a Lite Assessment Report for user onboarding.

## Key Design Choices
Speed prioritized over extreme depth for initial setup.

Database-first architecture to allow incremental future updates.

Modular Initial Evaluation (initial_evaluation.py) separate from daily analysis.

Allow future enhancement: deeper re-analysis, finer playstyle classification.

## Success Criteria
Lite Assessment completes successfully on typical hardware in < 2 hours.

Generates coherent skill summary from historical data.

Database is populated and ready for daily incremental use.

Framework ready for deeper assessments in later milestones.
