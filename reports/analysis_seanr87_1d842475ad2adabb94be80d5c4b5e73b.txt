1. Brief Summary:
In this game, you played as Black and faced the Ruy Lopez Opening with the Morphy Defense. The game went on fairly evenly until a critical mistake in the late middlegame led to a decisive advantage for your opponent, resulting in a resignation.

2. Key Moments of Mistakes or Blunders:
a. Move 14...O-O-O: Castling queenside in this position weakened your king's position and left it vulnerable to attack.
b. Move 18...Qf6: Moving the queen to f6 allowed White to play f4, initiating a strong attack on your king's position.

3. What You Should Have Done Differently:
a. Instead of castling queenside on move 14, it would have been safer to keep the king in the center or castle kingside to maintain a solid pawn structure and king safety.
b. Move the queen to a safer square, perhaps Qe7 or Qd8, instead of Qf6 on move 18 to avoid exposing it to potential threats.

4. Suggestions for Improvement:
a. Focus on king safety and pawn structure in the opening and middlegame to avoid unnecessary weaknesses that can be exploited by your opponent.
b. Pay attention to piece coordination and avoid leaving your pieces vulnerable to tactics or attacks.
c. Practice tactical awareness and calculation to spot potential threats and counterplay opportunities in the position.
