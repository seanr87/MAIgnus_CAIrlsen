1. The game started with the Scotch Game, Schmidt Variation. White played actively in the opening, gaining a spatial advantage and controlling the center. Black made some inaccuracies in the opening and middlegame, allowing White to build up a strong position.

2. The key mistakes made by Black were:
   - 7... Nxd4: This move led to material loss as Black exchanged a knight for a pawn without sufficient compensation.
   - 12... Qh4+: This move exposed the black queen to unnecessary risks and allowed White to gain a tempo with Kg2.
   - 17... f4: Pushing the pawn further weakened Black's king's position and left the f4 square vulnerable.
   - 18... Qh4+: This move didn't achieve much and allowed White to further solidify their position.

3. What Black should have done differently:
   - Instead of 7... Nxd4, Black could have considered developing the pieces with moves like Be7 or 0-0 to complete development before initiating exchanges.
   - Instead of 12... Qh4+, Black could have played more solidly with a move like Bd6 to reinforce the center and prepare for further development.
   - Instead of 17... f4, Black could have focused on improving the piece activity with a move like Rd7, connecting the rooks and preparing for potential central breakthroughs.
   - Instead of 18... Qh4+, Black could have considered improving the position of the rooks or reinforcing the weak pawn structure.

4. To improve for future games, focus on the following aspects:
   - Piece development: Prioritize developing pieces actively and efficiently in the opening to maintain a strong position.
   - Center control: Pay attention to controlling the center and maintaining a solid pawn structure to support your pieces.
   - Tactical awareness: Be cautious of tactical opportunities for both sides and calculate variations carefully before making moves.
   - Endgame understanding: Study basic endgames to improve your technique in converting advantages and defending inferior positions.
