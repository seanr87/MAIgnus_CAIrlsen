## Game Summary
In this game, White's seanr87 scored a convincing victory over Black's MBCL420. The game started with the Danish gambit, which is a sharp and aggressive opening aimed at rapid development and control of the center. The Average Centipawn Loss (CPL) of 101 suggests that there were quite a few inaccuracies from both players, signifying room for improvement in their chess prowess. 

Black's three blunders and numerous mistakes, including the loss of a pawn early in the game, allowed White to establish a commanding presence. Black's defensive play, notably 6...h6 and 7...Rh7, was insufficient to parry White's aggressive strategy. 

White's 14. Bxf5 capitalized on Black's positional weaknesses, and the subsequent piece play, leading to the capture of the Black's g8 knight and the h7 pawn, left Black in a dire situation. 

The game concluded with Black's resignation on the 18th move, after White's bishop seized the h7 pawn, leaving Black in a materially lost position. The game was a clear demonstration of the effectiveness of the Danish gambit and underlined the importance of accurate play in the face of aggressive opening strategies.
