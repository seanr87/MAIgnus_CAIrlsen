## Game Narrative Summary
In the game between Aggy14 (White) and seanr87 (Black), played under a 3-minute time control with a 2-second increment, Aggy14 emerged victorious. The game started off with an uncommon opening, with White immediately pushing the side pawn to a4. Black responded with a standard central pawn move to e5, setting the stage for an unconventional game.

White's unusual opening strategy seemed to catch Black off guard, with each subsequent move escalating the tension on the board. After exchanges on e4, the board was dominated by a number of powerful bishops, with a dynamic and open position. The critical point of the game came when White's bishop took the pawn on d3, which opened a line for the queen. This led to an aggressive attack on Black's king that ultimately forced Black to resign.

Black's biggest mistake was perhaps not reacting appropriately to the atypical opening and failing to manage time effectively. The latter stages of the game were rushed due to time pressure, leading to poor decisions and mistakes. With better time management and a more thoughtful response to the unusual opening, Black might have been able to hold their ground. However, this game serves as a lesson in the importance of flexibility and adaptability in chess.
