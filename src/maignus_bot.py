Main execution script for MAIgnus_CAIrlsen chess analysis bot.

This script orchestrates the full workflow:
1. Fetch new PGN files from Chess.com
2. Analyze the latest game using modular GPT analysis
3. Send an email with the analysis

Usage:
  python maignus_bot.py           # Regular run (only analyzes if new games found)
  python maignus_bot.py --force   # Force analysis of latest game regardless of whether it's new
